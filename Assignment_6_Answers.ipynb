    ">- Python variable is also known as an identifier and used to hold value.\n",
    ">- In Python, we don't need to specify the type of variable because Python is a infer language and smart enough to get variable type\n",
    ">- Based on the data type of a variable, the interpreter allocates memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory. Therefore, by assigning different data types to variables, you can store integers, decimals or characters in these variables.\n",
    ">-  It is recommended to use lowercase letters for the variable name. for eg. 'Sachin' and 'sachin' both are two different variables\n",
    "\n",
    "> **`Examples:`**\n",
    "\n",
    "                        i)  sachin = 10  (Integer type)\n",

    "                        iii) info  = \"Data Science\"   (string type)\n",
    "                        iv) value = 10+20j   (Complex type)\n",
    "                         v) digits = True    (boolean type)\n",

    "\n",
    "> **`Rules to define Variable:`**\n",
    ">- The first character of the variable must be an alphabet or underscore ( _ ).\n",
    ">- All the characters except the first character may be an alphabet of lower-case(a-z), upper-case (A-Z), underscore, or digit (0-9).\n",
    ">- Identifier name must not contain any white-space, or special character (!, @, #, %, ^, &, *).\n",
